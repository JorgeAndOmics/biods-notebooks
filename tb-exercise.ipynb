    "Welcome to a brief introduction into comparative genomics. Specialized database queries and sequence alignments form the backbone of innumerable research projects across the world, and the fight against TB makes extensive use of these tools. Some among the uses of these technologies are:\n",
    "- Identifying point mutations in selected genes across different strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb).\n",
    "- Tracking the natural history of Mtb across regions and time periods.\n",
    "- Revealing patterns of spread and transmission through phylogenetic analysis.\n",
    "- Discovering potential targets for new drugs by comparing gene sequences between drug-resistant and drug-susceptible strains.\n",
    "- Assessing the genetic diversity of Mtb strains to inform vaccine development and tailor treatments to specific variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we embark on this journey, we'll explore how to programmatically retrieve DNA sequences from specialized databases and how to compare them in insightful ways. This workshop is designed to equip you with the knowledge and tools to contribute to the global effort against TB through the lens of bioinformatics. Even though we will use real-word, up-to-date data throughout most of the exercise, it is directed towards a wide audience and doesn't require any previous knowledge of bioinformatic pipelines, or even Python! \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have no experience with code whatsoever, fret not! This exercise is designed to lead you effortlessly straight to the end. If for some reason you break it, restart and voilà. If you are already familiar with programming, this exercise should be of use to understand how biological data is retrieved and aligned. Feel free to tinker with other parameters and explore how the code works!\n",

    "Last but not least, across the exercise you will see many hyperlinks scattered across the sections. Click on them to access extra resources that will enrich your experience, add context or reveal interesting facts about the lesson.\n",

    "Congratulations! You just imported the necessary libraries to perform all the analysis in this exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, a library is a collection of precompiled routines - sets of instructions - that a program can use. These routines are designed to accomplish specific tasks, such as handling files and data, performing mathematical computations, or managing network connections - and that is exactly what we are going to do with these. Many of these libraries we will be using, like pandas for tabular data management or the powerful numpy for mathematical operations, are used everywhere across the world in many different fields, from finance to weather forecasting. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "But before proceeding, we should have very clear what we are looking for. [Mycobacterium tuberculosis](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/mic.0.000601) genome is approximately 4.4 million bases in length, encoding around 4000 genes and innumerable non-codifying - but still important - regions. As researchers, we are often interested in specific segments of this whole, particularly those associated to traits in the pathogen, and one the most noteworthy ones is antibiotic resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is ample evidence of the association between the activation of certain genes in Mtb and antibiotic resistance. Some of the most prominent are:\n",
    "- [**rpoB**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8502021/): Mutations in the *rpoB* gene, which encodes the β subunit of RNA polymerase, are responsible for resistance to rifampicin, a key first-line drug for TB treatment. Resistance to rifampicin is a critical marker for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB).\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**katG**](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jb.175.13.4255-4259.1993): Mutations in this gene, which encodes catalase-peroxidase, are associated with isoniazid resistance. Isoniazid, another first-line anti-TB drug, requires activation by KatG to exert its antibacterial effect. Mutations in katG can lead to a loss of this activation, resulting in resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**inhA**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7856099/#:~:text=KatG%20and%20inhA%20gene%20mutations%20are%20the%20main,are%20activated%20by%20monooxygenase%20EthA%20and%20catalase-peroxidase%20KatG.): This gene encodes an enzyme involved in the synthesis of mycolic acid, a component of the Mtb cell wall. Mutations in the promoter region of *inhA* can also confer resistance to isoniazid.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**embB**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33210572/#:~:text=Ethambutol%20%28EMB%29%20is%20one%20of%20the%20first-line%20drugs,for%20around%2070%25%20clinical%20EMB%20resistant%20M.%20tuberculosis.): The *embB* gene is associated with resistance to ethambutol, a first-line drug that targets cell wall synthesis. Mutations in embB can affect the drug's ability to inhibit the arabinogalactan synthesis, leading to resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look into the first one, *rpoB*, and its role in rifampicine resistance development. [Rifampicine](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01045) is a widely used antibiotic used in TB treatment, and works by inhibiting the RNA polymerase enzyme, which is crucial for RNA synthesis. When used in combination therapy, rifampicin helps prevent the development of drug-resistant TB strains. However, monotherapy or improper use of rifampicin can lead to the emergence of resistance, which is a growing concern worldwide. \n",

    "1. We use pairwise alignment algorithms to obtain the best matching score between our sequences given our scoring scheme.\n",
    "2. We fill the matrix sequentially based on a set of instructions.\n",

    "1. Query Sequence: The user submits a sequence to BLAST, which serves as the query.\n",
    "2. Database Search: BLAST compares the query sequence against a database of sequences to find matches.\n",
    "3. Identify Matches: It identifies high-scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by looking for word matches between the query and database sequences and then extending these matches to find longer alignments without significant gaps.\n",
    "4. Scoring: Each potential alignment is scored based on the number of matches, mismatches, and gaps, with higher scores indicating better alignments.\n",
    "5. Results: BLAST returns a list of database sequences that are similar to the query sequence, including alignments and statistical measures of significance (such as [E-values](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/E-values), which estimate the number of chance matches in a database of a given size).\n",

That is, not only identifying the DNA sequence and its variations, but what each part of the sequence does. [The 1000 Genomes Project](https://www.internationalgenome.org/home) remains one of the largest repository of genomic human variation data, and it is heavily used by the biomedical community. Both are spiritual successors of the [Human Genome Project](https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project), often considered the Manhattan Project of biology.\n",
    "- [AGAThA (GPU Acceleration of Guided Sequence Alignment for Long Read Mapping)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06478) aims to take sequence alignment to the next level by enabling GPU parallel architectures into alignment algorithms, while [Embed-Search-Align using Transformer Models](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2309.11087) takes inspiration in the similarities between DNA sequences and human languages, using technology originally developed for natural language processing (NLP).\n",
